# OmniaRide 🚗

OmniaRide is a lightweight ride-hailing MVP focused on clean UI, map-first interaction, and realistic trip state simulation.

This project is intentionally built without external APIs to validate core UX, state flow, and map behavior before scaling.

---

## ✨ Features

- Map-first ride interface (OpenStreetMap via Leaflet)
- Trip lifecycle simulation:
  - `idle → requested → assigned → enroute`
- Floating call-to-action and status overlays
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Global state management using Zustand

---

## 🧠 Why this MVP exists

This MVP is designed to:
- Validate user experience before API integration
- Demonstrate clear separation of UI and state logic
- Serve as a foundation for future phases:
  - live driver tracking
  - routing & ETA
  - payments
  - real-time updates

---

## 🗺️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Maps:** OpenStreetMap (Leaflet / React-Leaflet)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
